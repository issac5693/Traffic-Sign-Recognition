## Traffic Sign Recognition
Traffic Sign Recognition is a model built using a Deep Learning framework called the Convolutional Neural Network which specializes in understanding and learning from image data. <br>
The model takes in an image as an input and classifies it between 43 different traffic signs. The code that I used to built the model and the model itself are present in this repo
